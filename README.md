# Welcome to the HUB-Datacube

The HUB-Datacube package (_hubdc_) offers a high level interface for integrating heterogeneous raster datasets into a 
user-defined reference pixel grid, resulting in an analysis-ready datacube.
The data model is build on top of [GDAL](http://gdal.org/) and 
was greatly inspired by the [RIOS](http://rioshome.org) project. 

Like RIOS, HUBDC provides functionality which makes it easy to write raster processing code in Python,
but it gives the user more flexibility and has some performance improvements.
