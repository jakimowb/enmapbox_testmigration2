# EnMAP-Box 3

![build status](https://img.shields.io/bitbucket/pipelines/hu-geomatics/enmap-box.svg)

The EnMAP-Box is QGIS Plugin to visualize and process remote sensing raster data.
It is particularly developed to handle imaging spectroscopy data, as from the
upcoming EnMAP sensor.

Highlights:

* visualization of vector and raster data in parallel maps

* collection and visualization of Spectral Libraries

* enhances the QGIS Processing Framework with many algorithms commonly used in
  remote sensing and imaging spectroscopy, e.g. raster classification based on
  Support Vector Machines or Random Forests

* easy GUI and API to make use algorithms brought by scikit-learn with raster data,
  e.g. machine learning approaches, clusterer, pipelines...
