# EnMAP-Box 3

The EnMAP-Box is QGIS Plugin designed to process hyperspectral remote sensing data,
and particularly developed to handle data from the EnMAP sensor.

Features:

* visualization of vector and raster data in parallel maps

* collection and visualization of Spectral Libraries and Spectral Profiles

* various algorithms specific to questions and workflows from the fields of
  remote sensing and imaging spectroscopy

* machine-learning algorithm from the scikit-learn library for raster and vector data processing,
  e.g. support vector classifiction / regression based on raster images and shape files.
