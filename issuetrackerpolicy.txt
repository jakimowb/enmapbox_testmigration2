We use the tracker to ...

1. plan releases via milestones, e.g. Milestone = "3.10 (Feature)"
2. plan hotfixes via milestones, e.g. Milestone = "3.9 (Hotfix)";
   if a bug can't be fixed, we set it "on-hold" and refere to it as a known-issue
3. collect external feature requests:
    - if we don't like it, we set the issue to "closed"
    - if we like it:
        - ... we may schedule it for the next release, e.g. Milestone = "3.10 (Feature)"
        - ... we may schedule it for a "Future Release - Nice to have"
    - if we aren't sure if we like it, let it sit
4. internal feature requests are handled like external feature requests, but they have to be scheduled (we shouldn't fill up the tracker with our loose ideas of new features)

Additional rules:

1. If an issue is scheduled for a version, e.g Milestone = "<version> (Feature/Hotfix)", we also set an Assignee.
