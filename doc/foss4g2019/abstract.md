## Earth Observation data analysis in QGIS using the EnMAP-Box and other plugins

Earth observation data is becoming a more and more important source for geospatial data analysis, 
and its availability increases with new satellites and open data access policies. 
Missions like the ESA Sentinels and the USGS Landsat program record data globally and with 
high temporal density, while hyperspectral missions like PRISM and the upcoming [EnMAP](www.enmap.org) satellite will 
provide images with high spectral resolution. 


In research and education, this increases the demand for free and open source software to explore 
and analyse big and multidimensional raster data volumes in combination with other GIS data. 
Because the demands of remote sensing analyses often go beyond the capabilities of classic GIS software, 
the Humboldt-University Berlin have been developing the [EnMAP-Box](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io) over the past 10 years. We would like to share our experience and to give a workshop that uses the EnMAP-Box and other free and open source QGIS plugins to cover the following aspects:


* <i>Don’t be afraid of high-dimensional datasets:</i> structure and visualization of multi- and hyperspectral raster data
* <i>Artificial turf, green grass and dry vegetation:</i> spectral characteristics of different land covers, spectral profiles and spectral libraries
* <i>Machine-learning made easy:</i> support vector machines and random forests to classify surfaces and to estimate biophysical parameters
* <i>Take your time:</i> visualization and labeling of multi-sensor raster time series, temporal characteristics of land surfaces
* <i>Hubs and archives:</i> how to get free remote sensing data
* <i>A look behind the front-end:</i> how to use EnMAP-Box and other python APIs to analyze raster data.

Our workshop addresses QGIS GIS users with none to medium experience in remote sensing data analysis.
