## Option A) clone the repository via command line

If you are familiar to Git and Git LFS use: 

`git lfs clone https://bitbucket.org/hu-geomatics/enmap-box.git`

## Options B) clone the repository via SourceTree

If you have no expirience with Git Repositories, we recommend to use
[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). 
This graphical Git client is nicely integrated within Bitbucket and allows a 
seamless installation of the EnMAP-Box without command line interactions.

> Note that the following intructions are examplified on a Windows system. Dialogs my appear in a slightly different look on MacOS or Linux systems. 

Download and install [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). 
If asked, agree to the **Upgrade Git LFS** and **Upgrade Git LFS Bitbucket Adapter** dialogs.

Now we can use SoureTree to clone the EnMAP-Box repository. Select `File -> Clone / New`

- select a **Destination Path**, e.g. `C:\QGISPlugins\enmap-box`

- press **Clone**

If asked, aggree to the **Run 'git lfs pull' now** dialog
